Minishell is a one of the largest projects in 42 educational program. It provide a great opportunity to create own mini version of bash shell from scratch using C programming language. Honestly most part of the students that didn't have experience in programming before 42 school scary this project, because it contain a lot of edge cases that you didn't find in subject but need to handle by your self. After all I can tell that everyone can finish this project.

It's not hard. It's just huge.  

### A bit context

Greatest part of the 42 Common Core course is a learning how modern technologies works under the hood. Some of projects provide you unique opportunity to explore how operation system works. There you being know about different types of parallel program work, file descriptors, temporary files, basics in system administrating and etc. So, at least the student that starting this project know how to use command terminal!

### Let's start!

Minishell is a partner project. One student make **parsing** part (receive and storage information before and during program work), another one make **execution** part.
